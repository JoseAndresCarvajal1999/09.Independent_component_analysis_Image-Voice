# 09.Independent_component_analysis_Image-Voice

When we are having a conversation in a noisy environment, our brain has the capacity to
separate sounds and focus its attention on an only conversation. This behavior is known
as the cocktail party problem and can be replicated through independent component
analysis. This method gets independent and non-Gaussian mixed signals, starting from
sensors, and using mathematical and statistical elements, like the negentropy and the
kurtosis it can separate those signals. This process can be applied in images.
